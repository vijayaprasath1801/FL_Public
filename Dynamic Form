Creating a Reusable Dynamic Form: Analysis and Implementation Plan
Overview
You need to create a dynamic form system that:

Works with different tables/entities

Supports both "Add" (empty form) and "Modify" (pre-filled form) modes

Dynamically generates form fields based on table columns

Handles form submission to dynamic API endpoints


Breakdown of Steps
1. Analysis (1-2 hours)
Understand your current table structure and API endpoints

Identify common patterns in your tables (required fields, data types, etc.)

Plan the form component architecture

2. Core Components (4-6 hours)
Dynamic Form Generator: Component that creates form fields based on table schema

Form State Management: Handle form data, validation, and submission

Modal Wrapper: Component to display the form in a modal

API Service: Generic service to handle different endpoints
