Creating a Reusable Dynamic Form: Analysis and Implementation Plan : 

Overview : 
You need to create a dynamic form system that:
Works with different tables/entities
Supports both "Add" (empty form) and "Modify" (pre-filled form) mode
Dynamically generates form fields based on table columns
Handles form submission to dynamic API endpoints


Breakdown of Steps
1. Analysis
Understand your current table structure and API endpoints
Identify common patterns in your tables (required fields, data types, etc.)
Plan the form component architecture

2. Core Components
Dynamic Form Generator: 
Component that creates form fields based on table schema
Generate input fields dynamically based on formSchema.
Pre-fill values when modifying an existing row.

Form State Management: 
Handle form data, validation, and submission
Create a schema that defines:
Field names (based on table columns).
Field types (text, number, select, etc.).
Validation rules (optional, required, max length).

Modal Wrapper: 
Component to display the form in a modal
Clicking Modify should pass the rowâ€™s data to the form.
Clicking Add should open an empty form.

API Service: 
Generic service to handle different endpoints
Pass schema and API URLs as props.
Ensure form adjusts dynamically for each table.


3. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Create Form Configuration 
Step 2: Dynamic Form Component
Step 3: Modal Integration 
Step 4: API Service 
Step 5: Connect to Table
